Could not memory leak issues. I suspect it has to do with the way I insert a new header where
there could possibly be space in my free and realloc(ptr, 0) calls.

Could not fix realloc constantly moving the addresses around for the last few cases. Whatever this
problem is, it could be the source of the memory leaks and seg faults.
